# A Basic Quantum Informatics Toolkit for Mathematica

## Description
This is a collection of basic tools and useful syntax for doing quantum information in Mathematica.

At the moment the package is quite rudimentary; it is a partial spin-off of the basic quantum information theoretic tools used for the package: [homological-tools-4QM-mathematica](https://github.com/tmainiero/homological-tools-4QM-mathematica).

Included are: basic ket syntax wrappers, wrappers for GHZ/W states, partial trace operations, permutations of tensor factors, and functions for computing von Neumann entropy, (multipartite) mutual information and its generalizations.

In the future I will add some basic gate operations.

An interactive quick start guide/minimal documentation is included in `quick_start.nb`.

Most functions are documented.  (If we are interested in a function `functionOfInterest`, a description can be found by evaluating `??functionOfInterest`.)

## How to Download

### Git

`git clone https://github.com/tmainiero/quantum-info.git`

### From the Github web interface
Click that fancy green "Clone or download" button on the top right!
Then "Download ZIP".


### File by File

#### From the Github web interface:
1. Go to the file you want to download and click it to view the contents
2. Locate the "Raw" button (On the top right at the time of writing) and right click.
3. Save as...

Make sure that all files are located in the $Path of your Mathematica directory, if not the same folder!
